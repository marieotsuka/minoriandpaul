	              <p> Minori and Paul have planned a trip to NYC every Christmas, so Paul knew that an NYC proposal would be the best possible present. The where came easy, but the “how” was difficult. </p>
	              <p>
	              First he had to ask her parent’s permission — a custom not ordinarily done in Japan. It took a little convincing for them to understand why Paul insisted that he picked up their dog, Sheila, in person at 8:00 am before a trip. Kenji, her father, was equally confused as to why such an occasion necessitated him getting out of bed. But he did, and Paul explained that their daughter made him the happiest man on earth. He showed them the ring and they knew it was serious. He kept debating how to do it. Rockerfeller Center? There is a great Christmas Tree, but crazy crowds. Bryant Park? A lesser Christmas Tree, but lesser crowds as well. </p>
	              <p>
	              Upon approaching NYC Paul realized the folly of these plans. They both required him to wait until nightfall, and Paul has never been known for the virtue of patience. So they began walking around the city, and Paul decided that they should visit the Peace Memorial in Central Park. Minori was confused by how antsy Paul was being all day, but she went with it. They began walking, and Paul decided to tell a story for Minori.</p>
	              <p>He told how once upon a time, they met as children. They reconnected at a wedding and fell hopelessly in love. Minori insisted that the “in love” part happened much later, but Paul was convinced it was on the same night. As the story meandered, much like this one, Minori was confused why they seemed to be endlessly wandering. The confusion came to a head when Paul insisted that they stop for a second on a scenic rock overlooking the ice rink. </p>
	              <p>
	              He said that he hoped their story ended with a happily ever after and as he got down on one knee he asked her if she could be the person to make that happen. She started crying (despite swearing it would never happen), Paul got excited to hug her and got off his knee too early. They spent the next hour wandering around New York on cloud 9 — an experience that won’t be exceeded until this April.

                           Satori was Minori’s first travel buddy, food “sharing” companion, fashion adviser and harbored Minori’s love for Legolas during the 17 times they were dragged to see (the first) Lord of the Rings with their mom. Satori's been in Washington DC kicking butt and saving the world for the past couple years, but Minori cannot imagine anyone else who would be standing next to her, as she has been for the past 26 years of their lives.

                        Todd and Paul grew up together in Wayland and have been best friends since preschool. When Paul moved from Arizona to Boston he moved in with Todd, and the rest is history. He was there when when Minori and Paul first started dating and even recommended they go on a first date to Tasca for the sangria. Paul has known him almost as long as Minori which makes him a perfect fit for best man.

                        Robby is Minori’s brother from another mother, and her ladybro. From chasing Minori to Sydney, and taking a trip to Japan together, to millions of arguments over the phone and gchat, they have experienced quite a bit together. Robby has been supportive of Paul and Minori's relationship from day one, and was the most encouraging which makes him perfect fit to the party. Minori can always count on him to be there (except for when he is playing halo).

                        Lauren and Minori have been in the same class every year since second grade to senior year in Wayland high school. They reconnected once they both lived (shamelessly) in their parent’s house down the street from each other over. When Minori moved in with Lauren, she was very supportive to have Paul as an extra roommate. Lauren is one of Minori’s first friends and one of the people who’s known Paul and knows them as a couple the best. This makes her a perfect fit for bridesmaids.

                        Marie is like Minori’s second sister (just a bit more talented and patient than the Shimizu bloodline). Marie’s family moved to Newton when Minori was in 5th grade and their families would spend every weekend together. They grew up with each other and shared all of the Thanksgivings and Christmases together while Hiromi, Minori’s mom cooked turkey and roast beef. Many thanks to Marie who made this website and designed every detail to our save the dates and invites.
